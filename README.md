**Description:**

The purpose of this modlet is to remove the accidental pickups of seed when farming. This is obtained by removing the melee collider from the cropsGrowingMaster. It then gives the seeds the CanPickup property which means they can be picked up with "E". The abilities extend through the two growth cycles and ends when it reaches the harvestable state. When harvested it returns to normal and the cycle restarts.

**Be advised that any seeds picked up during the growth cycle will have to be replanted and the cycle resets. If it can be picked up it is NOT ready for harvest! **

> Dependencies: None.

> Compatibility: Compatible with all mods or modlets that does not change the cropsGrowingMaster collider.
